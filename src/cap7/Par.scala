We can always do `fork(map2(a,b)(f))` if we want the evaluation of `f` to occur in a separate thread.

It simply passes the `ExecutorService` on to both `Par` values, waits for the results of the Futures `af` and `bf`, applies `f` to them, and wraps them in a `UnitFuture`. In order to respect timeouts, we'd need a new `Future` implementation that records the amount of time spent evaluating `af`, then subtracts that time from the available time allocated for evaluating `bf`.

  def fork[A](a: => Par[A]): Par[A] = // This is the simplest and most natural implementation of `fork`, but there are some problems with it--for one, the outer `Callable` will block waiting for the "inner" task to complete. Since this blocking occupies a thread in our thread pool, or whatever resource backs the `ExecutorService`, this implies that we're losing out on some potential parallelism. Essentially, we're using two threads when one should suffice. This is a symptom of a more serious problem with the implementation, and we will discuss this later in the chapter.
